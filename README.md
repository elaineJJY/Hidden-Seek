This is a geolocation-based Android client similar to Pokemon Go game. The details are showed in the document User Manual.pdf. 



## Goal

As lockdown policy has been conducted, offices, markets and gyms have been closed, people are getting bored to stay home. Lying in the sofa, working on the table, learning with the computer, all of these make our bodies more and more unhealthy. It is meaningful for our developers to create an application to motivate people to go out and have entertainment, without contacting with others physically. The designed game will achieve the goals of fitness, friend communication, meaning of education and enhancement of the awareness of environmental.
